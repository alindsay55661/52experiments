I spent the last 7 years building up my collection of studio gear and software. I have also spent many hours watching videos and reading reviews about various virtual instruments and hardware components I would like to expand my studio with. In all this time I have dedicated little effort to actually writing music. The constant excuse has been a life full of work and frankly I’ve felt consumed by “the grind”.

Recently life changes have afforded me some breathing room and balance. Additionally, prior to this I found myself very much out of life, out of energy and out of joy. When work becomes your life it is easy to lose the spirit of creativity, hope and identity. After dreaming about writing music for film and television for many years I realized, with the help of my wife, that it was something I needed to explore. Great joy has come into my life during the times that I have been writing and I am accepting that it is a continual therapy I need to embrace if I am to live a balanced life.

So with that premise I decided to start a project that would force me to learn all of the software and hardware I have built up over the years as well as increase my skill as a composer. In the spirit of [Chopped](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopped_(TV_series)) I thought it would be fun and challenging to write music in a small time frame based on a random selection of instruments. Nothing helps writers block like stirring the pot and providing a deadline! Hence the birth of 52 Experiments!

I hope you have as much fun listening to these experiments as I have writing them.
