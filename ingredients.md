All ingredient-based [Experiments](../) are made by randomly selecting (from a jar) five instrument patches in my library. Some patches are complete instruments with lots of articulations (such as patches that include key switching), some include multiple instruments (various synth patches for example) and then others are only a few articulations for a single instrument (like legato french horns). Whatever the case may be, once the patches are selected there is no turning back and it's time to make some music! Patches may only be used once. For more information see the [Rules](../rules).

EDIT 6/18/2014: Due to a large increase in my virtual instrument library I no longer publish the list of individual patches to draw from. There are simply too many to make sense of on this page. However, on each ingredient-based experiment page there is a list of the 5 randomly selected patches.
