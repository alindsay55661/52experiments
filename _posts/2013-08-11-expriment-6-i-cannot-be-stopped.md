This week I had the chance to experiment with rhythm and layering thanks to [Troels Folmann’s](http://www.troelsfolmann.com/) incredible knack at producing amazingly playable rhythmic instruments. Unlike the rest of Rhythmic Aura’s patches, the “Troel’s Brain” extra does not allow you to adjust tempo from half to straight to double so I had to run each patch at the same tempo and ultimately decided to do something that really ran fast. It wasn’t quite as flexible as the rest of the library but that led me in a direction I didn’t anticipate which was quite fun.

I worked the guitar in through a [Twin Peaks](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098936/)(ish) theme, only two to three times faster. The cellos give a nice pulse and of course the Aura’s are highly varied and keep the whole thing running. Violins resolutely suggest that something was lost and now it’s too late.

Lately I have been watching a lot of [Star Trek: The Next Generation](http://www.startrek.com/page/star-trek-the-next-generation) and when I hear this piece the only thing I can think of is [Data](http://www.startrek.com/database_article/data) unemotionally defeating a villainous opponent with an unanticipated move of superior logic, and then while the villain stares back at him in utter shock and surprise, Data explains how incorrect the villain’s thinking was, how correct Data’s thinking was, and finishes by resolutely stating as sure as the sun rises, “I cannot be stopped”. Ah, Data, you truly cannot be stopped.

Listen to the piece again… Now imagine the above scenario… Do you see it? Or do you see something completely different? Maybe I watch too much Star Trek :)
