Howdy! What a week this was for me. I started down at least 4-5 different paths before I began to figure out how this piece was going to shape up. When I auditioned all the sounds I had to work with I experienced some frustration. I couldn’t get a grasp on how they would mesh well together. After a few days of failed tests I accidentally layered one of the accordions over a tweaked vocal pad and I was surprised by something that sounded like a very unique and colorful pipe organ. This became the foundation for the tone and tension of the piece and I built everything else around it.

The percussion was also difficult to work with because it felt too small for what I was hearing. In the end I escaped using only two drum hits from one patch and altered it with some effects to get a more agreeable sound.

There were a lot of directions I could have taken this combination of instruments, an unlimited number of directions. But the one week deadline forced me to make a decision and move forward with it. I can say that it is truly an experiment in the fundamental sense of the word and it has provided me with exactly what I was looking for: education, exploration, a challenge and a creation. And best of all, the resulting creation encapsulates my memories of the experience.

Say what you will about the music, there are many flaws and things I don’t like, but for me Experiment 1 was a total success. It is the stepping stone to the next Experiment and the fuel for my journey on the road that leads to professional production. At the very least I can now say that I have scored accordions!
