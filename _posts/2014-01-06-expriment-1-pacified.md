Wow what a different experience this was for me. There are two reasons this Experiment was completely different than the others. One reason is that it uses the new format from the [Emotional Words](../introducing-emotional-words) track. So from the very beginning there was no guidance on instrument selection, I started with a completely blank slate.

The second reason is that over Christmas break I took [Peter Lawrence Alexander’s](http://www.professionalorchestration.com/about/peter-alexander/) [Visual Orchestration 1](http://www.alexanderpublishing.com/Departments/Visual-Orchestration.aspx) lesson. It was a great tool and the first step for me in really going beyond “dabbling at the keyboard”. I am very excited because in such a short time I was able to write music in a controlled fashion, intentionally aiming for a specific sound and achieving it. And in this case it is real music–that is, not a collection of effects and beats.

I have learned a lot but am just now taking my first step into the world of orchestration. There is so much for me to learn and I am excited for the journey. I hope you enjoy my first crack at the real thing: Pacified.
