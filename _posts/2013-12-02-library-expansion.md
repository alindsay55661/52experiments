It’s that time of year again, when sample library producers offer amazing discounts on the highest quality products available. I have been saving for this time of year like I always do and I’m happy to report I’ve expanded my library to include several major missing components:

- Brass – [EastWest’s Hollywood Brass](http://www.soundsonline.com/Hollywood-Brass)
- Scoring Piano – [8Dio’s 1928 Steinway](http://8dio.com/instrument/1928-steinway/)
- Cathedral Choir – [Sound Iron’s Requiem Light](http://www.soundiron.com/instruments/choirs/requiem-light-player-edition/)
- Vocal Solo Artists – [8Dio’s Forgotten Voices: Barbary](http://8dio.com/instrument/barbary/) and [Forgotten Voices: Francesca](http://8dio.com/instrument/forgotten-voices-francesca/)

This rounds out my collection rather nicely but I’ve already started saving for next year :) I am particularly excited about the addition of EastWest’s AMAZING brass library and the 1928 Steinway. Looking forward to some sweet tracks!
