I love working on these Experiments, they have been a blast. But because my time is so limited I’ve been unable to write any music other than what is done for 52 Experiments. Sometimes I need to do more, work with other instruments and have different constraints. As a result of this desire and my recent [library expansion](../library-expansion) I decided to introduce a second track of experimentation: Emotional Words.

Emotional Words is a very simple concept. I have a [list of words](../emotional-words) describing various emotions or emotional states. For this track of experimentation I randomly draw a single word from this list and write a piece of music that embodies that word. Clearly this is more subjective than the first track of experimentation, but that is the point. It is not without measurability though as some passages of music simply don’t work with some emotional states.

There are really no other constraints except deadlines (1 week per experiment like before). I am very excited about this as it provides the opportunity to help learn instrument selection and test theories about what sounds work well together. Tonight I had my wife draw the first random Emotional Word and the winner is… Pacified.

Nice! Will be interesting to see what I come up with for this. Stay tuned…
