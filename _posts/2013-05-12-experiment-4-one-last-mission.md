This week’s inspiration comes from one of my and my wife’s favorite shows: [Chuck](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0934814/), featuring music by the incredibly talented and diverse [Tim Jones](http://www.jonestimjones.com/). This is exactly the kind of work I would love to do and Tim provides no shortage of fun, explosive and moving [masterpieces](http://www.jonestimjones.com/music/chuck) in this hit series. There is nothing quite like nerdy retail computer support specialists teaming up with hardcore field spies. Add to the mix on demand super powers and you really can’t go wrong. If you are anything like me, you wanted more seasons of this incredible show. The groove I created here makes me dream of the future episodes that live only in my imagination–but trust me, Morgan and Chuck are pulling some comedic yet seriously sweet spy moves. Of course Sarah, Casey and his lady friend are sporting black suits and walking in slow motion (yes, Sarah remembers everything).

I started with the throbbing industrial bass (Skanner) and used that as the foundation. From there I experimented with several percussive flavors and decided to have a strong FX based feel. The main reason is that Kontakt Vintage just wasn’t working for me out of the box, so I ran both the F100 and Orchestrator through various GuitarRig 4 setups until I found some great textures. Finally, I made my first use of violin trills (which I love in this piece) to heighten the excitement during the main spy melody. I had a lot of fun working on this number, and I am having even more fun imagining Chuck and his team take to the streets for one final mission…
