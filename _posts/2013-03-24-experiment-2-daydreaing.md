Ok, this was truly an experiment.  After auditioning the sounds I knew exactly the direction I wanted to go… something that reminded me of Bela Fleck’s incredible [At Last We Meet Again](http://www.amazon.com/At-Last-Meet-Again-Version/dp/B003A9CA5Q) but mixed with the [Tron Legacy Soundtrack](http://www.amazon.com/Tron-Exclusive-Version-Digital-Booklet/dp/B004EI3ON4/ref=sr_shvl_album_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1364104831&sr=301-1). Bela Fleck has been a long time favorite of mine and Victor and Roy are incredible and renowned musicians, real musicians that play real instruments and they sound amazing. The Tron inspiration was based on the fact that I had to use synthesizers, something that is very new to me.

I began the week wanting to make a track that would fit with a suspense based trailer but it didn’t go that way. Instead I came out with a mix of very interesting emotions and quirky expressions. How does one label this creation? I will say bluntly that after having such a clear idea in my mind the result was completely unexpected and unintended. Composition aside, I learned a lot during this week about working with the software. There were some definite issues I had to work through to get something that had a sonic image I was happy with. In the end time killed my full dream but I will count this another successful experiment as it definitely upped my knowledge and skill level. And I kinda dig the bass harmonics…
