Hey all! This piece is my entry to the [Hans Zimmer Bleeding Fingers Competition](http://www.hanszimmerwantsyou.com/). I had a lot of fun working on it over the last few days. Go vote for me here: [http://www.hanszimmerwantsyou.com/tracks/3477](http://www.hanszimmerwantsyou.com/tracks/3477)

The progression for writing this piece was very different than everything I’ve done previously. That is because I have learned that in this business people typically set up a “template” which is really a common set of instruments and articulations that you start with every time you write. I purchased [Vienna Ensemble Pro 5](http://www.viennaensemblepro.com/) and have hosted almost my entire collection there which has made life much easier. I also bought [2CAudio’s B2 reverb](http://www.2caudio.com/products/b2) and applied that on the master track. In addition to using this new “template” format I’ve also been watching more of Peter’s awesome [Visual Orchestration series](http://www.alexanderpublishing.com/Departments/Visual-Orchestration.aspx) (Scoring Stages also) so there is a lot of learning going on right now.

One more project down and I’m getting closer to a realistic sound. Plus, I felt comfortable enough to put this baby in a competition and solicit peer review. Love it!
