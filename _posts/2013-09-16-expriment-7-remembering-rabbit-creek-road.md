After doing mostly fast moving pieces I knew this time around I wanted something slower with a reflective tone. Reducing the Electric Guitar Aura to half speed set a great pace. But this was added only after I free handed the guitar without a rhythm track. After mixing the two the out of time feel was so interesting that I kept it with only minor tweaks. Next I laid in the long violins with absolutely no vibrato until you reach those beautiful swells after the bass drop. To wrap things up I crescendo with electrified pulsating violins and a sudden shift of emotion from resolution to loss. The dramatic ending comes with thanks to the required use of Guitar Volume 005 which had only an octave of pre-recorded guitar chords. At first it was impossible to work those in anywhere, but they ultimately changed the entire mood and reshaped the direction of this otherwise “happy” number. These are the type of results I am looking for in an experiment like this and I am so glad I got them.

So, what do you think happened at Rabbit Creek Road? Let me know in the comments below!
