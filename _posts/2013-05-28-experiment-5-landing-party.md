I was excited to learn more about Hollywood Strings for this number. In this case there were some pleasant surprises and a few disappointments that really only have to do with the patches I selected, not the Hollywood Strings library. Lucky for me the Full Strings patch includes those amazing legato cellos that I used to start the number. I knew right away when I auditioned the sounds that I wanted to do something that would work in a sci-fi sequence. I am quite happy with the intro.
The unfortunate limitation with full strings patches is that each instrument has a smaller range–only one octave for basses, a bit more for cello and so on. This was a disappointment as I was hoping to really play up each section. I had to change my strategy which was to do a slow moving number featuring nice bass and cello movement. I also struggled with placement for the divisi violins because I kept changing my musical theme and reworking where solos should go.

In the end I leveraged a good deal of the Skanner bass patch, all of the electric sounds (including the drum hit) come from this sound set.

There isn’t one particular inspiration for this piece, I merely wanted it to work with a sci-fi theme. It was a major learning experience and I found myself struggling to wrap it up and cut some corners. But on the whole there are elements here that I love and I consider this another successful experiment.
