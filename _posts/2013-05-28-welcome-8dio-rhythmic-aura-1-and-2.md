Thanks to a little birthday gift from my parents and a nice sale at [8Dio](http://8dio.com/) I decided to add both Rhythmic Aura collections to my studio. I am very excited to put these to good work and fortunately [Experiment 6](../experiment-6-i-cannot-be-stopped) will feature one of these great patches (yes, selection was entirely random even though I really wanted to draw an Aura anyway).

Because I increased the number of sound sets I have modified the 2nd use rule. From here forward only one sound set from each Experiment may be returned to the pool. Looking forward to making some great tracks!
