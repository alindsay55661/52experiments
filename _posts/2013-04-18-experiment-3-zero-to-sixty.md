Inspiration this week came from my new favorite movie, [Wreck-It Ralph](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772341/). It recently came out on Bluray and the kids and I watched it a few times this month. There is something truly pleasing about the "[Owl City](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5346646/)" sound and [Henry Jackman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2273444/) did a great job with the highly electric numbers in the film in addition to traditional scoring. How can you not love the fact that arcade characters are so concerned with giving us a good game? Or that even bad guys want to be good? Or that there is a world of behind the scenes work and orchestration involved in providing the most entertaining and playful pursuits? Too many great points, don’t get me started. One thing is for sure, Wreck-It Ralph did an excellent job highlighting synthesis and keeping the music fun. I wanted to capture a piece of that feeling.

At first I was highly intimidated by the complexity of both Newscool and Skanner. These synths are very customizable and for a beginner like me, very complicated. But thanks to my current enrollment in Coursera’s [Introduction to Music Production](https://www.coursera.org/course/musicproduction) and some very useful tutorials by [Brent Kallmer](http://www.youtube.com/user/bkallmer) I was able to understand how to achieve the specific sounds I was going for. It was a short time for me to learn just the basics and honestly with Newscool I never did figure out how to start and stop the synth so I ended rendering the beats to audio and using audio clips instead. Whatever works!

Another successful experiment done, and as is sometimes the case I am happy to say I love the results!
