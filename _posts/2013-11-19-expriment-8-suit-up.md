Funny story, I started writing a sweet melody that was thoughtful and calming. Then my wife and I watched Man of Steel a few nights later. I came back to work on this Experiment and realized I had written the main melody from Hanz Zimmer’s [What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World?](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CKZX76C/ref=dm_dp_trk17_B00CKZX76C). I guess I had heard this track before and it seeped into my subconscious! So I had to start over from scratch because once I realize I am writing something I’ve heard before (different than just being inspired by another track) I have to go in a completely different direction or I get distracted by the original.

So, I started with the Bass Effects and laid down a rise and fall of the up/down repetitions. This was something that had been stirring in my head for a while. From there I threw in the Taiko Drums and sticks. I added the cello in the same range as the bass but with rhythmic variation every eight measures. Neither part (bass or cello) sounded right by itself but together they were giving me something gritty and awesome. Next I played with several violin melodies until I had something I’m pretty sure nobody else has written :). Finally, I threw in the “Vintage – Mini” which is the pumping electric bass featured in the intro and outro.

This time around I learned about reverb and mic positions. It took some tweaking to get everything into a similar space as some patches were divisi and others had prerecorded deep reverb. In the end I am happy with the result but I want to get more musical. I was excited about my first melody which turned out to belong to [Hanz Zimmer](http://www.hans-zimmer.com/)! I started looking into some tools to help me ([Synfire](http://www.synfire.com/)) explore music more melodically and less collection-of-sounds-y. But alas, going to defer this purchase as I have a few other libraries taking priority, stay tuned…
