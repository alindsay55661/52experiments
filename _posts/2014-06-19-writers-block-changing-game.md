Recently I’ve been overcome with fear. It happens to the best of us I’m sure–and for me it’s quite problematic as the purpose of this journey is to reconnect with my musical side and express otherwise inexpressible emotions through this medium. I was off to a strong start; the experiments were doing everything I hoped they would: inspiring me, stretching me, teaching me, helping me take steps toward professionalism and above all giving me a voice. I was so excited, and loving every minute of it. Then something changed…

I got so inspired I wanted to tackle orchestration, for real. I’ve always heard the music in my head but been unable to convey it. So I started studying. First it was instrumentation, then voicing, themes, harmony, blending… The more I studied the more I realized there was so much to learn. New terms like “counterpoint”, “bowings” and “combinations” entered my world. But this was just the beginning. That polished Hollywood sound doesn’t come for free either. I began studying orchestral mixing, reverb, spatial placement, dynamic range and how to make strings sound real. I found volumes upon volumes for all of these subjects and dedicated professionals to each one as well. It was like ripping a small hole into a Williams track and catching a glimpse of the enormous universe behind it. Gone was the sense of fiddling at the keyboard, humming a catchy melody or other playful engagements. I had entered the world of professionals.

On the one hand, this is exactly what I wanted, the secrets to unlock that music in my head. On the other, it set a standard I could not realistically meet, at least not under the conditions of my experiments. I wasn’t entirely sure how to deal with this, but for the most part I was happy to learn… until I applied that learning in a public forum.

“I’m ready”, I thought, “to enter competitions”. I had no expectation of winning, of course, but I felt worthy enough to compete and be taken half seriously. So I applied what little knowledge I’d gained and [submitted an entry to the Hans Zimmer Bleeding Fingers contest](../the-last-sunrise). This was a litmus test, to gauge how I would be received by the community. To my surprise the track got over 500 plays, 50 comments and 26 likes. I also gained some 30+ followers because of it. For someone with an unknown profile this was a big deal.

It confirmed a few things to me, not the least of which was that I could make music people will enjoy. While this experience was inspiring it was also terrifying. I had attracted attention to my work, attention I was not prepared for. Soon I began to wonder if I could reproduce the same caliber of music that gained me those 30 followers in the first place. Maybe this was just a miracle or an accident. Maybe I got lucky.

I sat down to write but nothing was coming. Days, weeks and even months passed. Despite earnest efforts no music was made since the competition. I was too afraid that I might fall short of my followers' expectations. The very knowledge that helped me get there was now beating me down. I knew how much I didn’t know and how far below professionals I really was. I had lost sight of my original goal, self expression. The music had become about everyone else and I was writing for the wrong audience.

Today I read an article about [why side projects should be stupid](http://firstround.com/article/Spotifys-Design-Lead-on-Why-Side-Projects-Should-be-Stupid). The whole point of the article was not to worry so much about the things you love. Growth, progress, professionalism… it will all come in time. The glowing realization that I was trying to force a specific path, perhaps one that others had taken, hit me like a ton of bricks.

The answer came after pondering a bit, but it came. I need to get back to writing for me so I can get back to writing at all. In order to do this I am removing the one constraint that interferes negatively with my work: time. Yes, professionals have deadlines. But I am not a professional, which is why I get to do whatever I want! :) So from here forward I will release my experiments whenever I decide they are done. And now that that is out of the way the inspiration is already flowing again. Tonight I worked on Experiment 2: [Kindness](../experiment-2-kindness) and put things right in the pocket. I’m looking forward to sharing it whenever it’s ready!

To anyone out there who may be stuck in a rut… remember why you started doing what you love.
