After a long period of [writer’s block](../writers-block-changing-game) I finally got back into my creative flow. I am more excited now than ever to be working on music as I rediscovered my purpose for it. While _I_ really am my own intended audience, I do hope you enjoy this work.

This experiment brought a lot of growth. I spent more time learning and understanding exactly what I was working on and how to achieve a specific sound. I knew from the start that I wanted to use a clarinet and some sweet string swells. After 3-4 theme iterations I settled on the basic song structure and from there it was a matter of finely tweaking each instrument. Honestly I am surprised I was able to pull this off, there are a few [Newman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002353/) chords in there that I literally found by accident. Of course once I did it changed the whole feel of piece and helped me bring things home as I was imagining.

This was a great experience for me because it required real musicality to convey an emotion like “Kindness”. I think I really like musicality and am going to avoid the percussion heavy trend on my next number: “Pain”.
