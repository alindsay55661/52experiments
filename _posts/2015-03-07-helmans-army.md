Where do I start? I'm a very lucky guy. My wife was recently contacted by Shelly Colvin who attends church with us. Shelly wanted to know if my wife would help edit a "short movie" (because Cristi is awesome with this, you should see our home videos!). I was immediately intrigued and hoped to secretly inject myself into the project to handle music. Lucky for me Shelly was willing to take a chance. The truth is I had no idea what I was getting myself into and oh what a fun ride it turned out to be :)

[Stephenie Meyer](http://stepheniemeyer.com/) had organized the event with several wards (local church congregations) to produce short films that tell a [Book of Mormon](http://www.mormon.org/beliefs/book-of-mormon) story. This was particularly exciting for me as I had often imagined many stories from the Book of Mormon as feature films. But let's not get carried away, this was just a group of volunteers putting together a 5-10 minute short with the youth :)

Even still, when it comes to music it's hard for me to take anything lightly. Music has the ability to evoke powerful emotions and is somewhat magical in that sense. For this project I felt a great responsibility to write music that engendered the proper emotions and conveyed the right message. I worked closely with Shelly for a few months to understand and capture her vision. This was a fantastic collaborative experience that taught me a lot about scoring for film instead of free style writing without the constraints of moving picture. What a great memory I have now.

Another challenge for me on this project was that Stephenie required each director to only use music from the hymn books. This meant instead of writing from scratch I would be arranging someone else's work. I can definitively say after this experience that I am not an arranger and I now have a deep respect for people who are. Arranging is a challenging task that, at least for me, is very different musically than original creation. But I survived it and had a few miraculous breakthroughs along the way. (And of course I used a liberal dose of artistic license! :))

The two hymns I arranged are "[We'll Bring the World His Truth](https://www.lds.org/music/library/childrens-songbook/well-bring-the-world-his-truth-army-of-helaman)" by the famous [Janice Kapp Perry](https://janicekappperry.com/) and "[True to the Faith](https://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/true-to-the-faith)" by [Evan Stephens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Stephens), both highly appropriate hymns for the film content. Though I found arranging difficult, it was a great pleasure to work with such fine material. I hope I did the authors justice. Below are the three tracks broken out in case you're like me and have a favorite.

And finally this post wouldn't be complete without presenting the film itself so you can see the music in context. It was a large group effort only made possible by the many people listed in end credits and some that aren't named anywhere. To Stephenie Meyer, thank you for organizing this great activity. To Shelly Colvin, thanks for taking a chance on me. To my incredible wife Cristi, I'm so glad we could work on this project together and thank you for letting me stay up till 2am so many nights so I could finish everything! :)

My only question now is... when can I do this again!? No, seriously.
