###Why Rules?

Experiments are all about creativity, exploration and discovery. This open agenda allows for and requires a great deal of free form and unstructured thinking. At the same time, any good experimenter will tell you that a successful experiment relies critically on one or more boundaries, or rules, which aid in measuring results. This dual nature of experimentation makes the process both challenging and fun and often leads to surprising outcomes.

###Rules for ingredient-based experiments

It's simple. Randomly select 5 [instrument patches from my library](../ingredients) and make a track using only (and all of) those 5 selections. To ensure randomness I actually physically pull numbers out of a jar. :)


###Rules for emotional word experiments

Emotional word experiments are even more simple. Select one emotional word and write a track that conveys the selected emotion. For these experiments I can use any instruments I want.


*Originally each experiment was confined to a single week and I was to do 52 of them representing a calendar year. This turned out to be [counter productive](../writers-block-changing-game) in my case so I no longer have time limits.
